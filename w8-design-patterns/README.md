## Design Patterns

I hope you enjoyed our lecture through the process of writing code and then 
refactoring it to make it better.

We talked about Cohesion and Coupling as forces that will help you make
decisions about how to write better code.

To illustrate that we applied the "module" pattern to convert a bunch of semi-disjointed
functions using a global variable into a highly cohesive module, running within a 
self-executing functions, taking advantage of closures to return a minimal
interface to the outside world.   While the refactoring effort was minimal,
the end result was so much more satisfying.
